# Figma to Website

View site [here](https://0xcire.github.io/food_service)

Built using SCSS, Astro

Wanted to use React or Solid but focused on really limiting bundle size this go around.

Obviously using a framework would improve development speed, though.

Overall, shows my ability to take a design, apply slight modifications as need be and create a near 1:1, or 1:1 implementation.

Some things like figmas layer blur with 800px radius was not replacable with css or svg filters so just making slight adjustments where needed.

note: this website is 1:1 with the reference design file at 1440px vw. Took liberties in imagining how design would scale up from mobile since those references were not included.

I believe I have an eye for design yet, my ability to realize my ideas is not there yet. So, as I attempt to learn everything under the sun at once, just proving I can use CSS and recreate designs. Wether that's a landing page, app component, etc.
