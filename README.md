Built using SCSS, Astro

Wanted to use React or Solid but focused on limiting bundle size and etc.

Overall, shows my ability to take a design, apply slight modifications as need be and create a near 1:1, or 1:1 implementation.

Not very confident in my own from-scratch design ability so this is proof I can use CSS to make designs come to life!
